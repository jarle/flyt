# flyt

_flyt_ is an Android/iOS speedreader app I wrote for learning Flutter and mobile app development.
The app displays one word at a time, which makes speedreading much easier.
Each word is displayed for 110 ms, which gives a reading spead of **545 WPM** - over double the average adult reading speed of around 250 wpm!

The app has very basic functionality and supports ebooks in the `.epub`-format.
